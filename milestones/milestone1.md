## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We was able to set up the skeleton for the front and backend smoothly without any major delays

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

At first when actually using the skeleton for the backend there was some problem with the app connecting to the client
I later found out that the enviroment variables were not set up properly hence why the app was not connected

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

So far everything is pretty simple and is going smoothly. We do not need anymore additional support
